Python Inheritance

~ Inheritance: a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class(called a superclass/base class).

~ Python, implements inheritance by creating a new class that inherits the properties [attributes and methods] of an existing class without modifying it.

Python has four build-in functions tha work with inheritance:

A. super(): returns a temporary object of the superclass, which allows you to call its methods.

B. isinstance(): returns True if an object is an instance of a specified class or a subclass thereof, and False otherwise.

C. issubclass(): returns True if a class is a subclass of a specified class or a subclass thereof, and False otherwise.

D. type(): returns the type of an object. In python, everything is an object, including classes, so you can use type() to determine the type of a class.
