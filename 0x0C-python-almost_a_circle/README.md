0x0C Python - Almost a circle

For this project, I used my knowledge Python object-oriented programming to code three connected classes that represent rectangles and squares including test suite using the `unittest` module to test all functionality for each of the classes.

The following Python tools were used:

~ Import
~ Exceptions
~ Private Attributes
~ Getter/Setter
~ Class/Static Methods
~ Inheritance
~ File I/O
~ `args`/`kwargs`
~ JSON and CSV [serialization/deserialization]
~ Unittest
