0x0B. Python - Input/Output

~ In this project I  was able to practice file handling.
~ This included the open() function: which is the primary function for opening files in Python. It has three parameters: file, mode, and buffering. The mode parameter determines the mode in which the file is opened. For example, 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'a' for appending, and 'r+' for both reading and writing.

~ I also dived into JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) which is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
~ In Python, the json module provides methods to parse JSON data from strings or files and convert Python objects to JSON data.
